Camera Calibration                      To compute the transformation between 3D object points in the world and 2D image points


Distortion Correction                   To ensure that the geometrical shape of objects is represented consistently, no matter where they appear in an image


Perspective Transform                   To transform an image such that we are effectively viewing objects from a different angle or direction
